<p><em>Sound and Basin</em> is a collection of poems rooted in geography, in landscapes, in the interstices where land and water collect and cohere to build memory. These poems carry the burden of ecological threats, the inevitable presence of extinction; the intersections are stopping points to collect and to name in the face of forgetting. From the oldest known carved bone, the Ishango bone, to the infrastructure that underlies the mystery of any city, "the threadwork holding together the castle" is contained in these poems that attempt to sing before the silence prevails. </p>
