<p>Eons after the destruction of Earth, an ancient god calls up memories of the late 20th Century in New Orleans. Someone or something is compelling him to relive a single night in the French Quarter in the 1980s. The god is Dionysos and his will is to subsume another acolyte into his beastly brood. He narrates the story of this struggle, as his human beloved, a failed classical composer working in a dead-end restaurant, tracks down his genius pianist ex-girlfriend and murderous father for direction. A man and a god wander the streets and bars of the French Quarter,
encountering a huge cast of inimitable characters and shadowy leftovers of gods and music—Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Messiaen, and scores of others. All the while, Dionysos struggles to unearth the secret of the mortals he loves and loves to hate, in the hope that he will finally be able to understand what he is.</p>

<p>C. W. Cannon's work is simultaneously emblematic of New Orleans and yet so original, strange, brainy and feral that it defies all geography. A novel of ideas, of voice, of sex, of music, and of the sheer wild power of language, this edgy joy/pain-ride over the teetery brink of disaffected youth into adulthood, in a place unlike any other, is from an American writer also unlike any other.<br />
  --Gina Frangello, author of <em>A Life in Men</em></p>
<p>C. W. Cannon's <em>French Quarter Beautification Project</em> is generous, crazy, Rabelasian, ambitious, and phenomenal.  Read it and find out what really goes on when Gods sink their teeth into men. <br />
--Moira Crone, author of <em>The Not Yet</em> and <em>The Ice Garden</em></p>
<p>Cannon follows his roaring bayou Gothic <em>Soul Resin</em>, with <em>French Quarter Beautification Project</em>, a wry and rollicking tour of the kind of New Orleans Ignatius Reilly knew, and then some.<br />
--Randy Fertel, author of <em>A Taste for Chaos: The Art of Literary Improvisation</em></p>
<p>  C.W.Cannon's work has appeared in <em>Other Voices</em>, <em>Third Coast</em>, <em>Exquisite Corpse</em>, <em>American Book Review</em>, <em>Constance</em>, <em>Louisiana Cultural Vistas, New Orleans Review</em>, <em>The Rumpus</em>, and the New Orleans <em>Times-Picayune</em>. He has been anthologized in <em>In Our Own Words: a Generation Defining Itself</em>, <em>Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?</em>, <em>Louisiana in Words</em>, and <em>New Orleans by New Orleans</em>. His novel, <em>Soul Resin</em> (FC2 Press, 2002), a New Orleans ghost story, was hailed by Luis Alberto Urrea as "truly original." His writing is found most frequently today in <em>The Lens</em> (thelensnola.org), where he contributes essays on New Orleans culture, the south, and race. His work in <em>The Lens</em> earned him the 2014 New Orleans Press Club Award for Best Column. He was the 2010-2011 Fulbright Professor of American Civilization at Université Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, Sénégal, where he promoted understanding (for himself and others) of the ancient ties uniting New Orleans and the Senegambian region of West Africa. He teaches writing and New Orleans Studies at Loyola University.</p>
